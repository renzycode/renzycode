 I am Renzy John Minerva. My passion is coding and designing. Moreover, I am also an aspiring web developer who can make both the front and back-end of a website. Also, I am fond of making applications using Python and Java programming languages. On the other hand, I am also a music producer and one of the artists of Minerva Bros in the genre called EDM.
